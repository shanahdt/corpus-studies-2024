Make sure that the code is looking for the data where the data is.\nFor example, if you download a file to your “Downloads” folder, on a Mac or Linux the code would read something like:\n\nhappy_birthday &lt;- readHumdrum(\"~/Downloads/happy_birthday.krn\")\n\nNote that the tilde (“~”) is a shortcut for “/Users/MyName/” etc.\nOn a Windows machine, it’s a bit different, but R should read the file correctly.

Put very succinctly, we might think of melodic intervals as being the “horizontal” (note x goes to note y), and harmonic intervals being the “vertical” (note x and note y are happening at the same time).\nBefore we tackle that, however, let’s first have a look at how to loop over multiple pieces, rather than just one."

    "text": "Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie\nLet’s have a look at two of the pioneers of Bebop as a way of exploring melodic practice on the whole corpus.\nFor each of these methods, we will run a loop that computes the scale degree, looking at it in relation to a broader key stated earlier in the file.\n\nHumdrumHumdrumRmusic21\n\n\nThe humdrum command runs a loop over all of the files with a kern extension in a folder. Here, my specific path of the folder is data/charlie_parker/ and then the * is telling it to look for “all files” with that extension. The * is commonly referred to as a wildcard.\n\n\nfor file in data/charlie_parker/*.krn\n    do\n        deg -a $file |\n        extract -f 1 | \n        grep -v '=' | \n        rid -GLId | \n        grep -v 'r'\n    done | sortcount -p\n\nThere are a few other important things to note with this code:\n\nBy running the deg command with the -a flag, I’m getting rid of other information, such as the melodic direction.\nThe | is referred to as a pipe. It allows the output of one command to become the input of the next command.\nI’m running the extract feature because this data has two spines. The right-hand column is chord symbols, which I’m not interested in at the moment, so I’m telling it to only take the melodies (and “extract” only field 1.)\nI then clean up my data by getting rid of all metadata and comments (with rid -GLId) and getting rid of the rests with grep -v 'r'. For those of you who haven’t used much bash before, grep is a a way of searching line-by-line, and the -v flag is an inverse search, so it I’m basically telling it to return all lines that don’t have an r in it, thereby excluding all rests. Before using this, you should ask whether rests are meaningful to your research question!\nNote that I’ve put this all in a bash loop, which is slightly more verbose than loops in python, but less than other languages (such as javascript or C++). Note the required do and done.\n\nThis gives us the following data. Put succinctly, 15.1% of notes in the Charlie Parker Omnibook are scale-degree 1, 12.72% are scale-degree 5, etc.\n\n15.1    1\n12.72   5\n12.17   2\n11.97   3\n10.1    4\n9.4     6\n7.64    7\n4.18    7-\n3.22    4+\n2.58    6-\n2.45    1+\n2.44    3-\n1.95    5+\n1.54    2+\n0.78    6+\n0.53    3+\n0.48    2-\n0.27    1-\n0.24    5-\n0.21    7+\n\n\n\nThe HumdrumR toolkit compiles corpora the same whether they contain a single piece or many, so we can just use the same readHumdrum command as before.\n\nlibrary(humdrumR)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nparker_omnibook &lt;- readHumdrum(\"data/charlie_parker/*.krn\")\n\n\nparker_omnibook_percentage &lt;- \n                parker_omnibook |&gt; subset(Spine == 1) |&gt; \n                deg(simple = TRUE) |&gt; count() |&gt; \n                as.data.frame() |&gt; \n                mutate(percentage = n/sum(n) * 100) |&gt; arrange(desc(percentage))\n\nThere are some things to point out here:\n\nHere I’m storing everything into a variable with the &lt;- tool.\nNotice that I have a corpus object (parker_omnibook) and I use the pipe object (|&gt;)\nInstead of the extract tool, I’m using subset, and telling it to just grab the first spine.\nI’m using the deg tool, and rather than deg -a in Humdrum, I can just say simple = TRUE and get the same results.\nI’m using the count command to summarize everything.\nOne of the roughest aspects of HumdrumR is it’s ability to play smoothly with native R data formats–I find that I often have to turn everything into a dataframe at some point.\nI then use mutate and arrange from the tidyverse toolkit. I created a percentage from scratch, rather than the sortcount -p flag in Humdrum.\n\nAll of the yields the following result:\n\n   Deg    n   percentage\n1    1 2383 15.289362248\n2    5 1991 12.774284614\n3    2 1901 12.196843321\n4    3 1724 11.061208777\n5    4 1522  9.765173874\n6    6 1484  9.521365328\n7    7 1182  7.583728988\n8   7-  635  4.074169126\n9   3-  544  3.490311818\n10  4+  504  3.233671243\n11  6-  477  3.060438855\n12  1+  449  2.880790453\n13  5+  307  1.969716412\n14  2+  213  1.366611061\n15  2-   72  0.461953035\n16  6+   64  0.410624920\n17  3+   43  0.275888618\n18  7+   43  0.275888618\n19  5-   31  0.198896446\n20 1++    9  0.057744129\n21 4++    7  0.044912101\n22  1-    1  0.006416014\n\nNotice that the data is slightly different between the two toolkits (15.1% vs. 15.29%). It’d be interesting to dive deeper a bit and see where these discrepancies lie…\n\n\nmusic21 is a bit pickier when it comes to importing Kern files. As such, I created a new set of cleaned files that gets rid of the chords. It’s not ideal, because the chords might be useful at another time. I think it’s probably worth cleaning up the data at the source in the future (if that’s possible).\nThe first step is importing everything.\n\nfrom music21 import analysis, note, converter, humdrum\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport glob\n\ndef filebrowser(ext=\"../data/charlie_parker_no_chords/*.krn\"):\n    \"Returns files with an extension\"\n    return [f for f in glob.glob(ext)]\n\nfile_list = filebrowser()\nfile_list\n\nNow we have a list of files, and the following function will import them, get the score, the key, and the scale degree (sd):\n\nfrom music21 import *\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef analyze_scale_degrees(file_list):\n    all_scale_degrees = []\n    \n    for file in file_list:\n        score = converter.parse(file)\n        key = score.analyze('key')\n        sc = scale.MajorScale(key.tonic)\n        \n        for pitch in score.pitches:\n            scale_degree = sc.getScaleDegreeFromPitch(pitch)\n            all_scale_degrees.append(scale_degree)\n    \n    scale_degree_counter = Counter(all_scale_degrees)\n    total_count = sum(scale_degree_counter.values())\n    \n    data = []\n    for degree, count in scale_degree_counter.most_common():\n        percentage = (count / total_count) * 100\n        data.append({\n            'Scale Degree': degree,\n            'Count': count,\n            'Percentage': f\"{percentage:.2f}%\"\n        })\n    \n    df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n    return df\n\n# Assuming file_list is defined\nresult_table = analyze_scale_degrees(file_list)\nprint(result_table.to_string(index=False))\n\nThis data will return it as a nice pandas table:\n\nresult_table = analyze_scale_degrees(file_list)\nprint(result_table.to_string(index=False))\n\nNote that it has a lot of NaNs, and the numbers are fairly different… This is definitely worth exploring a bit…\n\nScale Degree  Count Percentage\n          NaN   6041     23.75%\n          1.0   3788     14.89%\n          5.0   3313     13.03%\n          2.0   3013     11.85%\n          3.0   2720     10.69%\n          4.0   2713     10.67%\n          6.0   2134      8.39%\n          7.0   1713      6.73%\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise:\nOn Canvas there is a Dizzy Gillespie folder to supplement this Charlie Parker data.

This results in the following:\n\n\n1.78    5 4 3\n1.57    2 1 7\n1.46    4 3 2\n1.33    3 2 1\n0.9     6 5 4\n0.89    1 2 1\n0.85    6 1 3\n0.84    1 7 6\n0.82    3 4 5\n0.81    1 3 5\n0.78    7 1 2\n0.63    5 3 4\n0.62    2 7 1\n0.62    1 2 3\n0.58    1 7- 6\n\n\n\nFor this one, I’ve commented the code a bit more, as I had to do a few workarounds to get it working.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidytext)\n\nparker_omnibook |&gt;\n    ### grab only the first spine.\n  subset(Spine == 1) |&gt;\n    ### turn the data into simple scale degrees.\n  deg(simple = TRUE) |&gt;\n    ## as before, make it into a dataframe.\n  as.data.frame() |&gt;\n    ### clean the data a bit and only get the V1 column, and get rid\n    ### of the null data tokens (\".\")\n  select(V1) |&gt;\n  filter(V1 != \".\") |&gt;\n    ### the lead function gets the next data from the current data.\n  mutate(next_note = lead(V1)) |&gt;\n    ### get rid of any NAs that show up.\n  filter(!is.na(next_note)) |&gt;\n    ### start creating a table in the \"bigram\" column\n  unite(bigram, V1, next_note, sep = \" \") |&gt;\n    ### gives us the n column\n  count(bigram, sort = TRUE) |&gt;\n  ### this is the mutate code from before.\n  mutate(percentage = n / sum(n) * 100) |&gt;\n  #### get only the top 15 results.\n  head(15)  \n\nThis gives us this data:\n\n   bigram   n percentage\n1     2 1 620   3.978184\n2     5 4 506   3.246712\n3     1 2 421   2.701315\n4     4 3 408   2.617902\n5     1 7 393   2.521655\n6     3 2 377   2.418993\n7     3 5 364   2.335579\n8     7 1 355   2.277831\n9     1 6 320   2.053256\n10    3 4 298   1.912095\n11    1 3 290   1.860764\n12    6 1 289   1.854347\n13    6 5 288   1.847931\n14    7 2 252   1.616939\n15    1 1 242   1.552775\n\nIf we wanted to look at 3- or 4- grams we could just update the code a bit in the middle:\n\n  parker_omnibook |&gt;\n    ### grab only the first spine.\n  subset(Spine == 1) |&gt;\n    ### turn the data into simple scale degrees.\n  deg(simple = TRUE) |&gt;\n    ## as before, make it into a dataframe.\n  as.data.frame() |&gt;\n    ### clean the data a bit and only get the V1 column, and get rid\n    ### of the null data tokens (\".\")\n  select(V1) |&gt;\n  filter(V1 != \".\") |&gt;\n    ### the lead function gets the next data from the current data.\n   mutate(\n    #### now I'm grabbing a next note and a next, next note.\n    next_note = lead(V1),\n    next_next_note = lead(V1, 2)\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(next_next_note)) |&gt;\n  unite(trigram, V1, next_note, next_next_note, sep = \" \") |&gt;\n  count(trigram, sort = TRUE) |&gt;\n  mutate(percentage = n / sum(n) * 100) |&gt;\n  #### get only the top 15 results.\n  head(15) \n\nThis gives us the following:\n\n   trigram   n percentage\n1    2 1 7 251  1.6106263\n2    5 4 3 245  1.5721253\n3    3 2 1 171  1.0972793\n4    4 3 2 171  1.0972793\n5    1 2 1 142  0.9111910\n6    7 1 2 131  0.8406057\n7    6 5 4 127  0.8149384\n8    1 7 6 124  0.7956879\n9    6 1 3 124  0.7956879\n10   3 4 5 121  0.7764374\n11   1 3 5 114  0.7315195\n12   2 7 1  93  0.5967659\n13   2 1 6  92  0.5903491\n14   7 2 1  91  0.5839322\n15   1 2 3  90  0.5775154\n\nAnd so on…\n\nparker_omnibook |&gt;\n    ### grab only the first spine.\n  subset(Spine == 1) |&gt;\n    ### turn the data into simple scale degrees.\n  deg(simple = TRUE) |&gt;\n    ## as before, make it into a dataframe.\n  as.data.frame() |&gt;\n    ### clean the data a bit and only get the V1 column, and get rid\n    ### of the null data tokens (\".\")\n  select(V1) |&gt;\n  filter(V1 != \".\") |&gt;\n    ### the lead function gets the next data from the current data.\n \n  mutate(\n    ###LOLZ so many mutations...\n    next_note = lead(V1),\n    next_next_note = lead(V1, 2),\n    next_next_next_note = lead(V1, 3)\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(next_next_next_note)) |&gt;\n    ###ok, this is just ridiculousnesslessness.\n  unite(fourgram, V1, next_note, next_next_note, next_next_next_note, sep = \" \") |&gt;\n  count(fourgram, sort = TRUE) |&gt;\n  mutate(percentage = n / sum(n) * 100) |&gt;\n  #### get only the top 15 results.\n  head(15) \n\n\n\nThe python code uses a similar logic as above, but includes the zip and list tools to create bigrams:\n\nfrom music21 import converter, scale\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef analyze_scale_degree_bigrams(file_list):\n    all_bigrams = []\n    \n    for file in file_list:\n        score = converter.parse(file)\n        key = score.analyze('key')\n        sd = scale.MajorScale(key.tonic)\n        \n        scale_degrees = []\n        for pitch in score.pitches:\n            scale_degree = sd.getScaleDegreeFromPitch(pitch)\n            ## for some reason NONE was coming back sometimes.

    "text": "Melodic Intervals\nIn terms of melodic intervals, we can think of it in terms of (1) simple intervals or (2) compound intervals, and with each of those can include the melodic direction. It’s worth thinking about whether your research question requires one of these over another.\nReturning to “Happy Birthday”, perhaps I have a research question about how often melodic leaps are followed by steps:\n\n\n\nHappy Birthday\n\n\nNot that the first melodic interval is a unison (a P1), and the second is an ascending major second (D going to E). It’s then followed by a descending major second, and an ascending perfect fourth. Open Music Theory has a good introduction to this, if you’d feel like you could use a bit of an introduction or refresher.\nBack to our research question, we want to know what intervals are followed by leaps. For Humdrum, music21, and HumdrumR, it will primarily be the same code, but with some minor changes. In terms of Humdrum we can just take our old code for deg, but change deg to mint.\nFor example, the code below does a few things: (1) it calculates the melodic interval with mint, (2) it gets rid of the metadata with the rid tool (global, local, interpretative, and data tokens with the GLId flags), it (3) gets rid of barlines with grep -v, it (4) runs the context tool to get note-by-note transitions, and then it (5) counts all of these and gives a percentage with sourtcount -p.\n\nmint ../data/happy_birthday.krn | rid -GLId | grep -v '=' | context -n 2 | sortcount -p \n\nThis gives us the following:\n\n12.5    +M2 -M2\n8.33    -M3 P1\n8.33    P1 +M2\n4.17    -m2 -M3\n4.17    P1 +M7\n4.17    +M7 -M3\n4.17    +P4 -m2\n4.17    P1 +P8\n4.17    -M2 +P5\n4.17    -m2 -M2\n4.17    -m3 -M3\n4.17    -M2 +P4\n4.17    -M2 -M3\n4.17    [d] P1\n4.17    -P4 P1\n4.17    -M3 -m2\n4.17    +P5 -M2\n4.17    -M3 +M2\n4.17    -M2 -P4\n4.17    +P8 -m3\n\nIf we aren’t intereseted in the melodic direction, we could have just added the -a flag to mint.\nIn terms of the research question, I want to know what intervals follow big intervals. So I will use what is called a regular expression.\n\nmint ../data/happy_birthday.krn | rid -GLId | grep -v '=' | context -n 2 | grep '[45678] '\n\nThis returns this data:\n\n+P4 -m2\n+P5 -M2\n-P4 P1\n+P8 -m3\n+M7 -M3\n\nThe final part of the code (grep '[45678] ') has brackets, which means it’s searching for 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8, followed by a space (which is what context returns).\nAlthough I’m using Humdrum here, it’s worth knowing that regular expressions can be used in all of the languages and toolkits that we are working with.\nSo a brief comparison of the code:\n\nHumdrumHumdrumRmusic21\n\n\nThe code from above can help us with this.\n\nmint ../data/happy_birthday.krn | rid -GLId | grep -v '=' | context -n 2 | grep '[45678] '\n\n\n\nHumdrumR is pretty obviously derived from Humdrum here, in that you can just run the mint function. Again, the manual pages for HumdrumR (found here) are quite useful.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(humdrumR)\n\nhappy_birthday &lt;- readHumdrum(\"data/happy_birthday.krn\")\nmint(happy_birthday) \n\nThe code below is identical to the deg code above, but with mint instead of deg.\n\nmint(happy_birthday) |&gt;\n    as.data.frame() |&gt;\n    ### clean the data a bit and only get the V1 column, and get rid\n    ### of the null data tokens (\".\")\n    select(V1) |&gt;\n    filter(V1 != \".\") |&gt;\n    ### the lead function gets the next data from the current data.\n     mutate(next_note = lead(V1)) |&gt;\n    ### get rid of any NAs that show up.\n    filter(!is.na(next_note)) |&gt;\n    ### start creating a table in the \"bigram\" column\n    unite(bigram, V1, next_note, sep = \" \") |&gt;\n    ### gives us the n column\n    count(bigram, sort = TRUE) |&gt;\n  ### this is the mutate code from before.\n  mutate(percentage = n / sum(n) * 100) \n\n\n    bigram n percentage\n1  +M2 -M2 3  12.500000\n2   -M3 P1 2   8.333333\n3   P1 +M2 2   8.333333\n4  +M7 -M3 1   4.166667\n5  +P4 -m2 1   4.166667\n6  +P5 -M2 1   4.166667\n7  +P8 -m3 1   4.166667\n8  -M2 +P4 1   4.166667\n9  -M2 +P5 1   4.166667\n10 -M2 -M3 1   4.166667\n11 -M2 -P4 1   4.166667\n12 -M3 +M2 1   4.166667\n13 -M3 -m2 1   4.166667\n14  -P4 P1 1   4.166667\n15 -m2 -M2 1   4.166667\n16 -m2 -M3 1   4.166667\n17 -m3 -M3 1   4.166667\n18  P1 +M7 1   4.166667\n19  P1 +P8 1   4.166667\n20  [d] P1 1   4.166667\n\nWe can filter out the big intervals.

    "text": "Harmonic Intervals\nWe can think of vertical sonorities in a number of ways. First, we can think of harmonic intervals. Humdrum does this with the hint tool.\nFor this, we will need to look at a different dataset. Let’s look at the Barber Shop Quartet dataset. This can be found on both the Canvas page and the github repo.\n\nHumdrumHumdrumRmusic21\n\n\nWith Humdrum, we can just use hint instead of mint.\n\nfor file in ../data/humdrum_scores/Barbershop/*.krn\n  do  \n    hint  $file\n  done | sortcount -p\n\nThis gives us this data:\n\n7.91    P5 P4 M3\n6.89    P5 m3 A4\n5.69    M3 m3 m3\n5.61    P4 M3 d5\n5.24    M3 m3 P4\n4.58    m3 M2 M3\n2.62    m3 M3 P4\n2.54    M6 m3 M3\n\nThis means that, of the four voices, there’s a Perfect Fifth, a Perfect Fourth, and a Major Third, etc. (C-G-C-E). This is a major triad with the third of the chord in the top voice and the root of the chord in the bass.\n\n\n\nbarbershop &lt;- readHumdrum(\"data/humdrum_scores/Barbershop/*.krn\")\nhint(barbershop)\n\nThis returns this data:\n\n     1:  !! \"Are You From Dixie?\" by George Cobb, arranged ***\n     2:  !! from \"Close Harmony Classics for Barbershop Qua***\n     3:  !! copyright 1915 & 1952 by M.

If we want to grab only the intervals, we can look at it something like this:\nI think that\n\nx &lt;- hint(barbershop) |&gt; as.data.frame()\ny &lt;- paste(x$V2, x$V3, x$V4, sep = \"_\")\n\ny |&gt; count(sort = TRUE) |&gt; \n                as.data.frame() |&gt; \n                mutate(percentage = n/sum(n) * 100) |&gt; \n                arrange(desc(percentage))\n\nThis gives us this data. NOTE: Notice the null data tokens. How would I clean that up? (hint: it’s in some code above–NB: no pun intended on the hint).\n\n           ._._. 284 6.56192237\n2     +P5_+P4_+M3 186 4.29759704\n3     +m7_-m3_+M6 185 4.27449168\n4     +M3_+m3_+m3 164 3.78927911\n5     +m3_+M2_+M3 144 3.32717190\n6     +M6_-M3_+m7 128 2.95748614\n7     +M3_+m3_+P4 118 2.72643253\n8     +P8_-P4_+M6 105 2.42606285\n9     +P8_-m3_+P5  81 1.87153420\n10    +P4_+M3_+d5  77 1.77911275\n\n\n\nFor music21 we will import all of our files first:\n\nimport glob\nfrom music21 import *\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n\ndef filebrowser(ext=\"../data/humdrum_scores/Barbershop/*.krn\"):\n    \"Returns files with an extension\"\n    return [f for f in glob.glob(ext)]\n\nfile_list = filebrowser()\nfile_list\n\nOne of the strengths (and weaknesses) of music21 is the data structure, using a “stream” to store its data. Here, it’s actually quite useful, and we can grab many attributes of a single chord, such as the measure number, the beat, and a chord quality.

Some of you may prefer using Python or even the command line for projects, and that’s fine, but in class we will mainly be working with R.\nIn the code below, we install the necessary library.

It was also called the Ford-Columbia encoding language, and was intended to make it affordable and manageable for anyone to have their own scores, and to be able to print them cheaply. It was also the hope that non-musicians would be able to encode scores, which would make the process more affordable to all.\nAs such, notes were just encoded by a spatial point.\n\n\n\nThe DARMS Grid\n\n\nSo to encode something like “Happy Birthday” in DARMS, we might approach it something like this:\n!G\n!M3:4\n20E.U 20SU / 21QU 20QU 23QU / 22QU 20E.U 20SU / \n21QU 20QU 24QU / 23HU 20E.U 20SU /\n27QD 25QD 23QU / 22LQU 21LQU 19E.U 19SU /\n25QD 23QU 24QU 23H.U //\n\nThere are a number of different codes and tags that can be included, ranging from key signatures to instruments to articulations.

For example, with a key signature of one sharp, it could be G major, but it could also be in E minor. So an explicit mentioning of the key is helpful.\nPerhaps more abstractly, notice that this is a two dimensional score of sorts: every moment of time is a new line, meaning one can search by line to find specific instances.

    "text": "Overview\nCorpus studies, or distant readings of multiple musical works, are often employed as a way of better understanding issues such as the relationships between pieces, authorship, trends over time, or differences and similarities between genres. In this class, we will explore the techniques, history, and philosophy of such approaches, and will construct and analyze our own corpora. For the most part, this class will deal with notated scores, and students will be encouraged to ask their own research questions of the music that they are most interested in."

Student Affairs has multiple resources to support student wellness and mental health. If you are feeling distressed or overwhelmed, please reach out for help. Students can access confidential resources through the Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), Religious and Spiritual Life (RSL) and the Center for Awareness, Response and Education (CARE). Additional information on all of the resources mentioned above can be found here:\nhttps://www.northwestern.edu/counseling/\nhttps://www.northwestern.edu/religious-life/\nhttps://www.northwestern.edu/care/\n\nHomework\nThere will be regular assignments in which you will be asked to respond to do one of the following:\n\nCritically reflect upon a reading about the history, methods, and dilemmas commonly found in corpus studies\nWrite code that addresses a musical question (e.g. what's the most common pitch transition in this group of pieces?)\nAnalyze a given collection of musical data.\n\nTypically, we will have reading reflections due on Mondays, and code-related questions relevant to those readings due on Wednesdays.\n\n\nMidterm Project\nThe goal of this class is for you to both understand corpus studies as a method with a long history, and for you to be able to incorporate these methods in your own research. There will be a midterm project that is primarily used a stepping stone into your final project, and it will consist of presenting a literature review in which you situate your own research question within the existing literature and propose a study that examines this question. You may use existing data, but you might find it more relevant to you if you use your own dataset. Therefore, this would be a good time to have a bulk of your data encoded, so that you are aware of the time needed to construct your corpus.\n\n\nFinal Project\nThe final project will be focused on a research question of your choosing, and will be broken up into several a peer-reviewed first draft, a presentation, and a final paper."
